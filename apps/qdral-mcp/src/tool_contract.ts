/**
 * SG-000065 authoritative tool metadata contract.
 *
 * Every canonical MCP tool has exactly one entry. Registration,
 * annotations, profile-filtered discovery, the OAuth scope matrix, and the
 * local-only list are all derived from this record, and contract tests pin
 * it against the tool sources, the qdrald remote-session scope table, and
 * the parity inventory. Discovery filtering is never authorization: qdrald,
 * the remote-session lease, and the OAuth ceilings still enforce every call.
 *
 * Annotation semantics:
 * - `readOnlyHint`: the tool never changes local state.
 * - `destructiveHint`: the tool may delete or overwrite existing user data
 *   (file content, clipboard content, or arbitrary effects of a registered
 *   executable). Purely additive or index-only changes are not destructive.
 * - `idempotentHint`: repeating the call with the same arguments has no
 *   further effect.
 * - `openWorldHint`: the tool reaches beyond the local machine (network
 *   peers) or runs a registered executable whose effects are not modelled.
