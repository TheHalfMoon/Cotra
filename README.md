# Qdral

**Computer Orchestration & Trusted Runtime Access**

Qdral is an open-source, local-first MCP gateway that lets ChatGPT work with an explicitly trusted folder on your Windows computer through a small set of bounded tools, with local approval for anything that changes your computer. It connects through the OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel, so no inbound port is opened on your machine.

Qdral is not a remote shell, a remote desktop, or a "run anything" agent.

## What ChatGPT can do through Qdral

Exactly these 20 tools are exposed over MCP:

| Area | Tools | Approval |
|---|---|---|
| Status | `system_status`, `workspace_get` | none (read-only) |
| Files in a trusted workspace | `fs_stat`, `fs_list`, `fs_read`, `fs_search` | none (read-only, bounded) |
| File writes | `fs_write_preview`, `fs_write` | local approval for each write, bound to the exact content and current file hash |
| Git (local) | `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log` | none (read-only) |
| Git (local changes) | `git_branch_create`, `git_stage`, `git_unstage`, `git_commit` | local approval, bound to the exact repository state |
| Git (network) | `git_fetch_preview`, `git_fetch`, `git_push_preview`, `git_push` | local approval; see limitations |
| Processes | `process_spawn` | local approval; see limitations |

Everything else is denied. Qdral also contains capabilities that are deliberately **not** exposed to ChatGPT in this release (browser automation, Windows UI Automation, screenshots and coordinate input, clipboard, and destination-scoped HTTPS fetch); they cannot be reached over MCP.

### Current limitations

- `process_spawn` on Windows is restricted to `whoami.exe`, run in an isolated AppContainer.
- `git_fetch` and `git_push` require destination policies that `qdral` does not configure yet, so they fail closed in an installed Qdral.
- Release binaries are not code-signed (there is no paid certificate under the project's zero-cost rule). Windows SmartScreen may warn; verify the archive with `SHA256SUMS.txt` and the GitHub build-provenance attestation.
- Qdral runs only while you are signed in, because approvals appear on your desktop.

## How approvals work

- **SOFT approval** — a Qdral dialog appears on your desktop describing the exact action (for example, the file and content hash). Approve or deny it yourself. Each approval is used once, expires quickly, and is bound to that exact action, workspace, and policy.
- **STRONG approval** — Windows Hello (PIN, fingerprint, or face) for trust changes and emergency revoke.
- ChatGPT cannot approve its own actions: approvals come only from the local broker, and Qdral's own windows are excluded from automation.
- `qdral approvals` lists recent decisions; `qdral emergency-revoke` invalidates every pending approval.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or later, or Windows 11, x64.
- Node.js 20 or later.
- The official OpenAI tunnel client executable, and a Secure MCP Tunnel id (`tunnel_…`) and runtime key from OpenAI for your ChatGPT workspace. Follow OpenAI's documentation to create them; Qdral does not create, download, or redistribute them.
- No administrator rights. Do not use "Run as administrator".

## Install

1. Download `qdral-<version>-windows-x64.zip` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the project's GitHub Releases page (release automation only prepares drafts; a release appears there once the maintainer publishes it) and verify the hash:
   ```powershell
   $zip = "qdral-<version>-windows-x64.zip"
   $expected = ((Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS.txt) | Where-Object { $_ -like "*  $zip" } | ForEach-Object { $_.Split(" ")[0] })
   $actual = (Get-FileHash ".\$zip" -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
   if (-not $expected -or $actual -ne $expected) { throw "checksum mismatch: do not extract $zip" } else { "checksum OK" }
   ```
   On Linux or WSL, `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS.txt` does the same.
   Optionally verify provenance: `gh attestation verify .\qdral-<version>-windows-x64.zip --repo TheHalfMoon/Qdral`.
2. Extract the archive and run, from the extracted folder:
   `.\qdral.exe install`
   Every file is checked against `manifest.json` before anything is copied. Qdral installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Qdral`, readable only by you (and Windows itself), and adds `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Qdral\bin` to your user PATH (`--no-path` to skip). Open a new terminal afterwards.

## Configure

1. Add a workspace (a folder ChatGPT may use):
   `qdral workspace add myproject C:\path\to\project`
   Folders that contain Qdral's own data (for example your whole user profile) are refused.
2. Optionally grant workspace trust with Windows Hello: `qdral workspace trust myproject`.
3. Configure the tunnel:
   `qdral tunnel setup --client C:\path\to\tunnel-client.exe --tunnel-id tunnel_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   You are prompted for the runtime key without echo (or pass `--key-file <path>`). The key is stored only in Qdral's protected folder, passed to the tunnel client by file reference, and never printed or logged.

## Connect ChatGPT

1. `qdral start` — starts the official tunnel client under Qdral's supervisor. It reports `running` only when the tunnel client is alive and its local health endpoint answers.
2. In ChatGPT, connect to your Secure MCP Tunnel as described in OpenAI's documentation. ChatGPT then sees the 20 tools above.

## Connect local MCP clients (no tunnel required)

Local clients that can launch a command use `qdral mcp stdio`. It starts the same authoritative MCP server over standard input and output, with the same 20 tools and the same local approvals. No tunnel setup is needed. Standard output stays the MCP channel, so run it only through the client configuration below, not by hand.

Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qdral": {
      "command": "qdral",
      "args": ["mcp", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Codex and other command-based clients use the same command and arguments:

```json
{
  "command": "qdral",
  "args": ["mcp", "stdio"]
}
```

Mistral Vibe Code accepts a stdio entry in its MCP server list with command `qdral` and arguments `["mcp", "stdio"]`. Generic MCP clients and the MCP Inspector connect with transport `stdio`, command `qdral`, and arguments `["mcp", "stdio"]`.

`qdral` here is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Qdral\bin\qdral.exe` on your user PATH after install. It resolves the active verified release on every launch, refuses tampered or inactive payloads, and fails closed when no workspace is configured. Tested per-client files live in [`examples/mcp-clients`](examples/mcp-clients) (Claude Desktop JSON and Desktop Extension manifest, Codex TOML, Vibe Code TOML, generic shapes, and the Inspector qualification script).

## Connect over loopback HTTP (no tunnel required)

`qdral mcp serve` exposes the same 20 tools over Streamable HTTP on `127.0.0.1` only. It never binds a LAN address. Every request needs a per-user bearer credential:

```powershell
$env:QDRAL_LOOPBACK_TOKEN = "<at-least-32-characters-you-choose>"
qdral mcp serve
```

The listener prints its URL, for example `http://127.0.0.1:54321/mcp`, on standard error. Pass `--port <1-65535>` to choose the port instead of an ephemeral one. The credential is required on every request as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; missing or wrong credentials fail closed, as do forged `Host` or browser `Origin` values. Browser pages on other origins cannot drive the listener. Keep the token on your machine and never commit it.

Mistral Vibe Code HTTP mode and generic Streamable HTTP clients connect to the printed URL with the bearer header. Clients that can launch a command should prefer `qdral mcp stdio` above.

## Everyday commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `qdral status` | Installed version, configuration, and whether the runtime is running |
| `qdral doctor` | Full diagnostics; exits non-zero if any check fails (`--json` for details) |
| `qdral stop` | Stops the tunnel client and everything it started, and confirms they exited |
| `qdral workspace list` | Workspaces and their trust state |
| `qdral tunnel show` | Tunnel configuration (never the key) |
| `qdral help` | All commands |

## Diagnose problems

Run `qdral doctor`. Each check reports `PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, or `????` (could not be checked) with one line of evidence — Qdral never reports health it did not observe. Logs are in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Qdral\logs` (`tunnel.log`, `supervisor.log`, `lifecycle.log`); tunnel output is redacted before it is written.

## Update

Qdral never checks for or downloads updates by itself.

1. Download and verify the new release as in Install, then extract it.
2. `qdral update --source C:\path\to\extracted-release --check` shows the version change.
3. `qdral update --source C:\path\to\extracted-release` stops Qdral, switches versions, has the new version verify itself, and restarts it. If the new version fails its own check, the previous version is restored automatically and `qdral doctor` reports why.
4. `qdral rollback` returns to the previous version. Older versions require `--allow-downgrade`.

## Uninstall

- `qdral uninstall` stops Qdral and removes its programs and the PATH entry. Your configuration, tunnel key, logs, and audit/approval/trust history are **kept** and listed.
- `qdral uninstall --purge-data --yes` also deletes that data.
- Your workspaces are never touched.

## Building from source

`npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm run build`, then `cargo build --release --locked -p qdrald -p qdral-lifecycle --bins`, then `node scripts/package-release.mjs --out <dir>` to assemble a release directory and `node scripts/archive-release.mjs --release <dir> --out <dir>.zip` to archive it. CI builds with the deterministic flags in `.github/actions/build-package-qualify/action.yml` and checks that an independent rebuild is byte-identical.
