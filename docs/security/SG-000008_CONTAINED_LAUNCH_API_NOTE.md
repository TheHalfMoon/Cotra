# SG-000008 contained launch API note

Date: 2026-09-24

SG-000008 combines the stable Windows primitives qualified separately by SG-000006 and SG-000007.

The native Windows probe:
1. creates a unique temporary AppContainer profile with zero capabilities;
2. builds STARTUPINFOEX with PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES;
3. launches a fixed Windows system child with CreateProcessW using CREATE_SUSPENDED;
4. passes no inherited handles and a fixed safe-name scrubbed Unicode environment;
5. creates/configures a kill-on-close Job Object;
6. assigns the suspended child to the Job Object;
7. verifies Job membership with IsProcessInJob before resuming;
8. verifies TokenIsAppContainer on the child token;
9. resumes the child;
10. waits with a finite timeout, records its exit code, and cleans up.

Security interpretation:
- AppContainer is the resource-isolation boundary.
- Job Object is lifecycle/resource control, not the sandbox by itself.
- CREATE_SUSPENDED prevents user code from running before Job assignment.
- zero AppContainer capabilities means this grain grants no network capability.
- the fixed probe does not expose arbitrary execution to MCP.
- process.spawn and PowerShell remain denied after this grain.

Current Windows documentation also describes Experimental_CreateProcessInSandbox. Cotra does not use it as the v1 foundation because Microsoft explicitly marks that API experimental and subject to change. It remains a future evaluation candidate.

ABI provenance:
- PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES value cross-checked against Microsoft windows-rs / Win32 metadata.
- No Microsoft implementation source code is copied.
- FFI structures and declarations mirror documented public Win32 ABI only.


## Environment repair note

The first native Windows runs reached CreateProcessW but failed with Win32 error 203.

Microsoft's AppContainer documentation identifies LOCALAPPDATA as the profile root exposed to the AppContainer and states that LOCALAPPDATA, TEMP, and TMP are rerouted into AppContainer-accessible profile directories. A system-only environment omits user variables such as LOCALAPPDATA, so it is not sufficient for this launch path.

Cotra now constructs a sorted Unicode environment from a fixed safe-name allowlist. It includes Windows/system paths plus the user-directory variables required for AppContainer profile redirection. Arbitrary parent variables are not copied.

Required before launch:
- LOCALAPPDATA
- SystemRoot
- TEMP
- TMP

Allowed safe names:
- APPDATA
- ComSpec
- HOMEDRIVE
- HOMEPATH
- LOCALAPPDATA
- NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS
- OS
- PATH
- PATHEXT
- PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE
- SystemDrive
- SystemRoot
- TEMP
- TMP
- USERPROFILE
- WINDIR

The environment block is case-insensitively sorted and double-NUL terminated. No API keys, tunnel credentials, or arbitrary caller variables are inherited.
