# SG-000030 - Structured UIA SelectionPattern actuation security note

Status: IMPLEMENTATION CANDIDATE
Program: QDRAL-P09
Grain: SG-000030

## Purpose

SG-000030 establishes the third narrow QDRAL-P09 structured actuation
grain on top of the SG-000027 observation registry, the SG-000028 invoke
registry, the SG-000029 value registry, the SG-000018 replay-resistant
foundation, SG-000019 class enforcement, SG-000020 trust and revoke
records, and the closed QDRAL-P08 registry: a single approved
SelectionPattern shape bound to server-derived process identity, typed
window identity, typed element identity, expected tree generation,
expected control type, expected SelectionItem pattern support, expected
enabled state, expected current selection state, requested target
selection state, workspace scope, and policy revision, with fresh SOFT
approval digest binding including both selection states, immediate
pre-actuation stale-target revalidation, and protected Qdral
approval-surface exclusion.

No other new actuation authority exists in this grain. Invoke remains
closed under SG-000028 and value remains closed under SG-000029. Toggle,
scroll, focus, keyboard input, mouse input, `SendInput`, coordinate
requests, screenshots, clipboard access, network egress, and elevation
have no function in the select provider, policy, or dispatch layer. A
missing or denied UIA element is reported as stale or denied and must
never become coordinate authority; coordinate fallback is P10 work. No
mouse or keyboard fallback exists when SelectionItem is unavailable.

## Server-derived identity remains the core control

The select shape accepts only `element_id`,
`expected_tree_generation`, `expected_control_type`,
`expected_selected`, and `selected`. Caller-supplied PID, window handle,
UIA runtime id, selector, coordinate, approval material, secret fields,
and fallback directives are explicit `CapabilityDenied` or
`InvalidRequest` widening denials in the policy layer. Callers can only
present one server-allocated typed element identity plus its expected
generation, expected control type, expected selection, and requested
selection.

Well-formed but unknown identities fail closed as `TargetStale`.
Malformed identities fail closed as `InvalidRequest`.

## Selection eligibility and data safety

Only `ListItem`, `TreeItem`, and `TabItem` control types with
`SelectionItem` pattern support and enabled state actuate. All other
control types, unsupported patterns, disabled elements, password and
secret bearing elements, and protected Qdral surfaces are denied as
`CapabilityDenied`. Expected current selection is enforced and any
state drift fails closed without silent retargeting. Evidence carries
only identities, generations, control type, expected selection,
requested selection, and approval record.

## Approval binding

Every select carries fresh per-action SOFT approval with one-shot
exact-digest binding over workspace, policy revision, process identity,
process generation, window identity, window generation, element identity,
tree generation, control type, expected selection, requested selection,
and action material. The digest is computed from the server-resolved
binding immediately before approval, approval is consumed one-shot with
nonce and expiry, and dispatch revalidates the same binding set
immediately before the adapter call. Any material drift after approval
fails closed. No caller-supplied approval boolean is accepted, no
persistent reuse exists, and no remote delegation exists.

## Stale fail-closed behavior

PID reuse, process restarts, destroyed windows, reused window handles,
process and window mismatches, disappeared elements, replaced elements,
role-changed elements, regenerated trees, disabled elements, protected
surfaces, workspace changes, selection-state drift, and policy revision
drift all fail closed without silent retargeting. A successful select
advances the owning window tree generation and removes its elements so
stale identities cannot be replayed.

## Protected Qdral surfaces and secrets

Select can never target approval dialogs, STRONG presence surfaces,
workspace trust controls, emergency revoke, or security-sensitive Qdral
UI. Password and secret bearing elements are denied as targets, and
current secret values never enter records, history, logs, MCP responses,
snapshots, or evidence packets. Fail closed on uncertainty.

## Windows qualification and honest limits

The native adapter proves real process identity against Windows APIs on
Windows: the real PID, the real executable digest, the real session
identity, and the real process creation time as the start generation.
Live desktop select requires an interactive session broker, which remains
successor work, so the native adapter reports select as unavailable
instead of fabricating actuation. Deterministic select binding, stale
protection, eligibility, expected-state enforcement, approval digest
shape, and protected-surface behavior is proven through the injected
fake adapter on every platform. These limits are recorded honestly and
must not be read as interactive desktop actuation evidence.

## Retained behavior

All SG-000027 observation behavior, SG-000028 invoke behavior, SG-000029
value behavior, SG-000018 one-shot, expiry, digest, and history behavior,
SG-000019 SOFT and STRONG class enforcement, SG-000020 trust and revoke
behavior, and the closed P08 registry behavior are retained unchanged.
The existing `%SystemRoot%\System32\whoami.exe` spawn boundary is
unchanged. No MCP UIA tool exists, and the agent cannot reach UIA
capability through its own tool or input surface. Toggle and scroll
patterns remain successor work.
