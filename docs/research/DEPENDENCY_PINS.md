## Rust dependencies

SG-000001 direct Rust dependencies are limited to serde and serde_json.

No Windows API crate is required in SG-000001. The small Windows final-path calls are declared directly against documented kernel32 APIs to keep the trusted dependency surface narrow.

## Lockfile status

SG-000001 begins before lockfiles exist because this repository was bootstrapped empty. Exact-head CI is required before merge. Release hardening requires committed lockfiles and dependency audit evidence; absence of lockfiles must not be represented as release-ready reproducibility.
