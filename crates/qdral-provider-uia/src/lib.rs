//! SG-000027 read-only Windows UI Automation observation provider.
//!
//! This crate implements the narrow P09 observation authority authorized by
//! the SG-000027 SpecGrain: server-derived process identity, typed window
//! identity, typed element identity, bounded read-only tree observation,
//! stale-identity fail-closed behavior, protected Qdral approval-surface
//! exclusion, and password and secret redaction.
//!
//! No actuation authority exists in this crate. Invoke, click, value setting,
//! text entry, select, toggle, scroll, focus, keyboard input, mouse input,
//! `SendInput`, coordinate requests, screenshots, clipboard access, network
//! egress, and elevation have no function here and must fail closed in the
//! policy and dispatch layers. A missing UIA element is reported as stale or
//! denied and must never become coordinate authority; coordinate fallback is
//! P10 work.
//!
//! Identity model:
//! - process identities are server-allocated as `uia-proc-` plus 16 lowercase
//!   hex characters derived from the PID and the executable digest, and they
//!   carry the process generation so PID reuse and restarts fail closed;
//! - window identities are server-allocated as `uia-win-` plus 16 lowercase
//!   hex characters derived from the owning process identity and the window
//!   handle, and they carry the window generation so destroyed or reused
//!   window handles fail closed;
//! - element identities are server-allocated as `uia-el-` plus 16 lowercase
//!   hex characters derived from the owning window identity and the UIA
//!   runtime identity, and they carry the tree generation so disappeared,
//!   replaced, or role-changed elements fail closed.
//!
//! Windows reality: since SG-000063 the native adapter observes the live
//! interactive desktop read-only through Win32 and UI Automation (see
//! `native_desktop`): visible top-level windows of other processes in the
//! caller's session with real process identity (image path and creation
//! time), and bounded control-view trees with password values never read.
//! Outside the interactive window station it fails closed as unavailable.
//! Actuation, capture, and input remain unavailable in the native adapter;
//! their registry behavior is proven only through the injected fake adapter
//! and must not be read as interactive desktop evidence.
