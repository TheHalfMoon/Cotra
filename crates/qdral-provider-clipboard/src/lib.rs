//! SG-000038 bounded clipboard-read provider with SG-000039 bounded
//! clipboard-write extension.
//!
//! This crate implements the narrow P11 clipboard authority authorized
//! by the SG-000038 and SG-000039 SpecGrains: one explicit
//! `clipboard/read` shape returning Unicode text only, and one explicit
//! `clipboard/write` shape placing Unicode text only, each with a hard
//! 65536-byte bound, independent content-type verification,
//! deterministic secret-pattern denial, clipboard-sequence binding, and
//! bounded secret-free evidence.
//!
//! Every request represents a single bounded operation. Reads never
//! become persistent observation authority and writes never become
//! paste, input, keyboard, or desktop authority: clipboard write,
//! subscriptions, polling, monitoring, history collection, standing
//! sessions, input injection, and paste automation have no function here
//! beyond the single explicit placement, and must fail closed in the
//! policy and dispatch layers. Network authority does not exist in this
//! crate.
//!
//! Secret model: secret-pattern clipboard content is denied before any
//! placement or return path and never enters results, evidence, prompts,
//! logs, or MCP responses. Detection is deterministic pattern matching
//! over documented credential, token, key, seed, and Qdral-protected
//! families. It is not claimed to be perfect: novel exfiltration shapes
//! outside the documented families are a stated limitation, and the
//! fail-closed direction (deny on match, never leak on match) is the
//! guarantee.
//!
//! Windows reality: the native adapter moves Unicode text through the
//! real Win32 clipboard APIs (`OpenClipboard`, `GetClipboardData` and
//! `SetClipboardData` with `CF_UNICODETEXT`, `GlobalLock`,
//! `GlobalAlloc`) and binds the real clipboard sequence number
//! (`GetClipboardSequenceNumber`) without moving content for state
//! binding, so pre-approval and post-approval sequence drift fails
//! closed. A locked, empty, non-text, oversized, unwritable, or
//! otherwise unreadable clipboard fails closed with a typed error
//! instead of fabricated content. Deterministic read, write, bound,
//! denial, and secret policy is proven through the injected fake
//! adapter on every platform. These limits are recorded honestly and
//! must not be read as interactive clipboard evidence beyond what the
//! tests and the native gating test genuinely prove.
